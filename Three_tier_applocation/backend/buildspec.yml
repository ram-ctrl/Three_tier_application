# I’m looking at potential environmental variables or code snippets that might indicate a misconfiguration, like "http://localhost:3000" or "app.listen(". This could highlight exposed API endpoints.

# Enhancing security

# I’m thinking about checking for "http://localhost:" or "http://0.0.0.0:" to ensure an API endpoint isn’t mistakenly bound to all interfaces, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

# Spotting potential risks

# Considering how, when deploying to production on AWS, inadvertently using "localhost:3000" in the source code could indicate a mishap with development endpoints.
