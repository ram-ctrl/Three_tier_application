## **Summary**

- **Frontend Application:**  
  A simple React app that displays a static message. The build step here is very basic and simply copies static files. In a production setup, you would use a bundler to compile your React code.

- **Backend Application:**  
  A basic Node.js Express server that exposes API endpoints to serve and receive data.

You can further enhance these examples as needed. These files are designed to work with your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., CodeBuild) as well as for local testing.
